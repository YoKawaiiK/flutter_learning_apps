# Socket.io (Node.js) and Flutter app

A small application for creating a chat using websockets, Flutter, Node.js and Getx.
In the application, I used Getx: GetService, GetController, Bindings, Routing and Middleware.

## Attention

My goal was to use websocket technology in combination with the Getx state manager, so you will not find good design and other interesting solutions here.

## Features
### Realized features

- [x] Realtime update data in the app;
- [x] Simple Sign In and Sign Up;

- [x] Invite user when user has created his own Rooms;
- [x] Notification in App: invite, new uwer connect to Room;
- [x] Check Participants in Room.
